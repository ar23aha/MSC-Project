Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,CG,"I've replaced all my other fountain filters and the reservoir is still full. This is the only one I've seen that seems to work, and it is the only one I've used that does not leak. It's not clear how it will hold up if I use it on my cats, but it's pretty good."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,CG,"LT&T did not disappoint.  We have the characters we love in this book, and the way the author is able to make them fit into the story.  I think this is one of the best books I have read in a long"

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"This ball and squeeker has outlasted all the other squeaky dog toys, including the hippo kong, kyjen Platypus plush squeaky eggs.  The Kyjen Invicibles Plush Snake Stuffingless dog toy is still squeaking and in pretty good shape, the pup detached some trim but couldn't figure out how to tear it up.  She shreaded her Kong Ballistic Ring dog toy in nothing flat, sadly."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I really enjoyed this mystery as everything just fell in place from the start to finish. Of course there was a death to figure out the who dunnit part and then finish with a wedding. It was not a traditional wedding, but a wedding right along. A good read."
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,Puppy loves this donkey. She's a bit aggressive with it. I've had to stitch part of the neck back up. The sound box works great. No sign of her being able to remove it. I would buy this again if he meets his demise since he's her favorite.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Cuts perfect and last for an extremely long time. We use Freud exclusively in our shop. Best blades on the market. Only thing I would change would be to make them without the red paint. It sometimes transfers to the material that is being cut and has to be sanded off. On the other hand, the red blades look cool. This 40 tooth cuts better than other brands with 90+ tooth blades."
